#ML_ClassicalALgorithms

1)mlClassics-1 (k-Nearest Neighbour):
This program will predict the class of a car by using the k-nearest neighbour classification algorithm. The dataset has been imported from UCI Machine Learning archives and 80% of the data is the training set and the rest is the test set. Accuracy of the dataset will change with every execution.

2)mlClassics-2 (Suport Vector Machine(SVM)):
In this classification algorithm the model used is support vector machine(SVM). The dataset has been imported from the sklearn library and 80% of the dataset is used as the training set and the rest has been used as the tes set. Accuracy will change with every execution.

3)mlClassics-3 (Linear regression):
The classification algorithm used is linear regression.The boston housing dataset has been imported from the sklearn library and 80% of the dataset is used as the training set and the rest has been used as the tes set.The score is in the 70s. Coefficients and intercepts have been calculated as well. Accuracy will change iwth every execution.

4)mlClassics-4 (K-means algorithm):
The classification algorithm used is the K-means algorithm where clusters have been formed.The breat cancer dataset has been imported from sklearn. 80% of the dataset has been used as the training set and the rest has been used ast the test set. Accuracy of the dataset will change with every execution.
